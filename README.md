Step 1

User selects the main bit of the song and the main counter-bit of the song; maybe has to specify the ostinato pattern

Step 2
==

Program makes a song like this:

- Soft, minimally edited version of main-bit and counter bit
- Slightly louder, more instrumentation (no idea how audio software can do this)
- Slightly louder, starts to feel a little jazzy
- Medium volume, somehow a flute enters at the octave
- Even louder, get them drums rolling for real
- The insistence of the melody is slowly driving you mad
- The grandiosity of the horns has compelled you to weep
- THE OSTINATO DRIVES THE ENTIRE TEXTURE OF THE SONG
- Everything is making noise everywhere, we forgo the final counter bit and throw in a quick modulation and a finale

Step 3

The song is now improved
